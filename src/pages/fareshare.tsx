                              A capstone project for Sprinboard’s UX Design certification, Fareshare is a mobile application conceptualized with the design thinking process.

                              <p>
                              In order to better understand the UX and associated hurdles to the carpooling process, the discovery process was kickstarted through market and competitive research.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                              An initial survey was utilized to narrow down the focus to those planning to utilize the application to plan or find carpools for repeating trips.

                              A follow-up survey, with the help of a Likert scale analysis, showed that specificity by time, clear feature differences of information on nearby carpools versus frequent locations, and reviews being emphasized should also be considered.

                              Mobile was chosen as the format, differentiating itself from popular ride-sharing resources in the U.S like CarpoolWorld and Craigslist. This was largely due to the popularity of Uber/Lyft and the hopes of having an integrated chat feature.

                          The visual identity of the application was constructed through a mood board and style guide. Shades of green were utilized to appeal to both its usage in driving environments and for its use to promote natural/health benefits.

                          <p>
                          Users exhibited a need for more information as a carpooling service was something they were new to.

                          <p>
                          Users quickly searched a list prior to filtering, resulting in actions being hidden.
